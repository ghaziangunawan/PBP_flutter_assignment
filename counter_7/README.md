**- Explain what is meant by stateless widget and stateful widget and explain the difference between them.**<br>
Stateless Widget is widgets that does not have state objects meaning that it does not subjects to state changes or immutable. Meanwhile Stateful widget has a state object which is mutable and can subjects to change of state. For example, if we want to add a incrementer/decrementer functionality to our app then we need to have a stateful widget this is due to that in stateless widget we cannot add setState() function so the incrementer/decrementer wont change the initial state.
